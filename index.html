                        <h2>What is this game❓</h2><p></p><strong>Facilitators</strong>👩&zwj;🏫👨&zwj;🏫: An educational card game that you can use in any class scenario😲, from a class warm-up to a reviewing session!&nbsp;<br /><strong>Students</strong>👩&zwj;👧&zwj;👦👨&zwj;👧: A game you can use with your friends🤗 to review content outside of class!&nbsp;</p>
                        <br /><h2>Why is it special❓&nbsp;</h2><p>
                            <b>Inclusive🙌🏽🙌🏿🙌🏻:</b> The game is offered in the most spoken languages in San Francisco: English, Spanish, and Mandarin, allowing students to read cards in both their native and spoken language at school🏫. Furthermore, the game incorporates visuals🎨, easing students’ understanding of the cards🃏. 
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Participation:</b> In an online class of 25 students👨🏻‍👩🏻‍👦🏻 to 1 teacher👩🏿‍🏫, students have limited opportunities to participate and test their knowledge😥. Reduced groups and role assignation provide an organized structure for students to engage with what they have learned🤗. 
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Cooperation🤝🏽:</b> Creative and problem-solving challenges require students’ cooperation! In groups👨🏽‍👩🏽‍👦🏽, students can face challenges that they would feel unprepared to face alone🤷🏽. The power of groups allows for increased⬆️ levels of difficulty, enhancing students’ understanding of the subject. 
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Flexible:</b> The game is played by cards🃏, each lasting 2 minutes at most🤯! Facilitators can have students play a few cards as a warm up or play a whole deck to review the unit content! It is up to you!
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Feedback:</b> Most cards🃏 in the specialized deck provide either an answer or an example of what the answer should look like, guiding students learning🤗. If doubts persist, the note-taker📝 can write✍🏾 the question and wait to return to the main classroom to ask✋🏽 the facilitator. </p>

                        <br /><h2>How to play the game❓</h2><p>1️⃣ The game is best played in breakout groups of 5 
                            <br>2️⃣ Choose the languages that are most spoken in your team
                            <br>3️⃣ Spend around 2 minutes per card
                            <br><br><b>Roles</b>
                            <br>At the beginning, each student is assigned a role. Roles are designed to ensure organized and productive learning.
    
                            <br>1️⃣ Take time to understand the roles. Roles guide you through each round. Following them will make the game more dynamic!
                            <br>2️⃣  Role assignation changes every 5 cards. You can choose to shuffle roles earlier, but we only recommend doing so if you are already familiar with the game.
