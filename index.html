            One example: pull a card from deck, ideally “Two Truths One Lie 👀”.
            Georgi: Now we are all set! Let us pull a card from the deck to illustrate how this works! Here’s our card! “Two Truths One Lie 👀”
            [Speaker reads the card]: I am the speaker! So I will go ahead and read the card. [read the card] “Choose a part🧩 of a cell. Come up with two truths and one lie for its function and components🙊” “Pick challenging statements! 🔥 Let your classmates guess❓ which one is the lie”
            [Facilitator]: Ana (or someone else), you are the first one on my list! Want to answer the question?
            [Ana or someone else]: (Creates two truths and one lie about the topic-- can use ⚡Example: Vacuole 1️⃣It is a membrane-bound cell organelle 2️⃣ They help maintain hydric balance 3️⃣ There are only present in plants”
            [Someone else]: ⚠️The 3️⃣ statement is the lie! Vacuoles can also be present in animal cells!
            [Time keeper] We are already in 2 minutes, let’s go to the next card. But before, let’s get some confetti! [press confetti bottom]
