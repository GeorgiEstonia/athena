            <h2>What is this game❓</h2><p></p><strong>Facilitators</strong>👩&zwj;🏫👨&zwj;🏫: An educational card game that you can use in any class scenario😲, from a class warm-up to a reviewing session!&nbsp;<br /><strong>Students</strong>👩&zwj;👧&zwj;👦👨&zwj;👧: A game you can use with your friends🤗 to review content outside of class!&nbsp;</p>
            <br /><h2>How to play the game?</h2><p></p>1️⃣The game is best played in breakout groups of 5.<br />2️⃣ At the beginning, each student is assigned a role. Roles are designed to ensure organized and productive learning.<br />3️⃣ Students will draw cards from the deck and will have two minutes to solve it! Some challenges are solved individually and others require group cooperation!&nbsp;</p>
            <br /><h2>Why is it special❓&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>Inclusive</strong>🙌🏽🙌🏿🙌🏻: The game is offered in the most spoken languages in San Francisco: English, Spanish, and Mandarin, allowing students to read cards in both their native and spoken language at school😊. The game incorporates visuals🎨, easing students&rsquo; understanding of the cards.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Participation</strong>: In an online class of 25 students👩&zwj;👧&zwj;👦 to 1 teacher👩&zwj;🏫, students have limited opportunities to participate and test their knowledge😥. Reduced groups and role assignation provide an organized structure for students to engage with what they have learned🤗. Cooperation: Creative and problem solving challenges require students cooperation! Further, individual challenges also require students input!<br /><strong>Flexible</strong>: The game is played by cards, each lasting 2 minutes at most😲! Facilitators can have students play a few cards as a warm up or play a whole deck to review the unit content! It is up to you!<br /><strong>Feedback</strong>: Most of the specialized card deck provide either an answer or an example of what the answer should look like, guiding students learning 🤗. If doubts persist, the note-taker can always write✍🏾 the question and wait to return to the main class to ask✋🏽 the facilitator&nbsp;</p>
