What is this game❓

Facilitators👩‍🏫👨‍🏫: An educational card game that you can use in any class scenario😲, from a class warm-up to a reviewing session! 

Students👩‍👧‍👦👨‍👧: A game you can use with your friends🤗 to review content outside of class! 

Why is it special❓ 

Inclusive🙌🏽🙌🏿🙌🏻: The game is offered in the most spoken languages in San Francisco: English, Spanish, and Mandarin, allowing students to read cards in both their native and spoken language at school🏫. Furthermore, the game incorporates visuals🎨, easing students’ understanding of the cards🃏.

Participation: In an online class of 25 students👨🏻‍👩🏻‍👦🏻 to 1 teacher👩🏿‍🏫, students have limited opportunities to participate and test their knowledge😥. Reduced groups and role assignation provide an organized structure for students to engage with what they have learned🤗.

Cooperation🤝🏽: Creative and problem-solving challenges require students’ cooperation! In groups👨🏽‍👩🏽‍👦🏽, students can face challenges that they would feel unprepared to face alone🤷🏽. The power of groups allows for increased⬆️ levels of difficulty, enhancing students’ understanding of the subject.

Flexible: The game is played by cards🃏, each lasting 2 minutes at most🤯! Facilitators can have students play a few cards as a warm up or play a whole deck to review the unit content! It is up to you!

Feedback: Most cards🃏 in the specialized deck provide either an answer or an example of what the answer should look like, guiding students learning🤗. If doubts persist, the note-taker📝 can write✍🏾 the question and wait to return to the main classroom to ask✋🏽 the facilitator.
